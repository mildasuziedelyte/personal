            <p id="story-button">For longer and more hearty introduction press here.</p>

            <div id="story" class="story-hidden"> 
                <p>Well, everything you have read above is true, but here you can find a bit longer introduction. as you may already know my name is Milda and I am on my way to becoming front-end developer.</p>
                <p>I have spent last six months studying the fundamentals of full-stack development at Baltic Institute of Technology. It is funny though, how the whole story of me becoming a developer have started years ago. Around the time of finishing school my parents took me to get career aptitude test done. Guess the result? Web development. Well at that time this choice looked scary both for me and my parents, but after going few different paths, now I am ready to admit that I want to be front-end developer.</p>
                <p>I believe I have some traits that would help me:</p>
                <ul class="traits">
                <li>I take tasks seriously - I listen, hear and try to accomplish.</li>
                <li>I love problem-solving and organizing, so I try to find and understand the best possible ways, I discuss and reconcile if needed. </li>
                <li>My eyes and brain admire accuracy and I show attention to details, so apart from the fact that these 2px in the wrong place will never see the light, I enjoy writing clean code that works well.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I know there is still plenty to learn and I believe the best place to do that is on the job. so if I have caught your attention, again - let's <a href="./contacts.html">get in touch</a>.

            <!-- <p>hi, my name is Milda and I am on my way to becoming front-end developer.</p><p>for the last six months I have been studying the fundamentals of <span style="font-weight:500">full-stack development</span> at Baltic Institute of Technology, but the whole <span id="story-button"><img id="story-arrow" class="story-hidden" src="../img/curved-arrow.png" alt="">story</span> of me becoming a developer have started years ago. Anyway, I believe I have some traits that would make me good developer:</p>
            <ul class="traits">
                <li>I take tasks seriously - I listen, hear and try to accomplish.</li>

            </ul>
            <p>I know there is still plenty to learn, but that does not scare me, as continuous self-development is one of my key values. </p><p>Even so, I believe the best place to learn is on the job, so if I have caught your attention - let's <a href="./contacts.html">get in touch</a>.</p>
            <p id="story" class="story-hidden">I have always been math and logic oriented, thus did not really believe in destiny related things, yet… Finishing school, I was not sure where to do, so my parents took me to get career aptitude test done. Guess the result? IT. At that time it looked scary, my parents were not sure if that is the best choice for me and I did not know what to think, especially considering the developer stereotype about ten years ago. Thus, I started studies, that I quit after 1.5 years, then the other studies followed, that I absolutely adored, yet quite fast understood it is not what I want to do daily. And as life went on at some point I took another career test, guess the result again? It is like I see it in front of my eyes written - software developer and web designer! But life took another turn again… So, event though I do not know exactly what was stopping me every time, now I am pretty sure I am ready to admit that I want to be front-end developer.</p>         -->
